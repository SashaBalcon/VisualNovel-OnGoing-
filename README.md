This repository contains the source code and assets for an interactive horror visual novel. The project demonstrates a custom-built backend architecture designed to handle complex narrative branching and large-scale asset management.

Technical Stack & Features
Language: Python

Library: Pygame

To improve long-term scalability and narrative efficiency, I am currently refactoring the core engine:

Narrative Logic: Transitioning the pages of script logic to Ren’Py to handle dialogue and branching more natively.

Hybrid Integration: Developing a bridge to implement custom Pygame modules within the Ren’Py files to handle complex card-game mechanics and specialized mini-games.
